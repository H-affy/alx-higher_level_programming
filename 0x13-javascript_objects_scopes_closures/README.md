Javascript objects and scopes closures

JAVASCRIPT OBJECT
An object is a collection of related data and/or functionality. These usually consist of several variables and functions (which are called properties and methods when they are inside objects). Class are a templates for creating objects, they encapsulate data with code to work on that data. Classes in JS are built on prototypes but also have some syntax and semantics that are unique to classes. The super keyword is used to access properties on an object literal or class's [[Prototype]], or invoke a superclass's constructor.

Prototypes are the mechanism by which JavaScript objects inherit features from one another. In this article, we explain what a prototype is, how prototype chains work, and how a prototype for an object can be set.
